1. This project was mainly inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/oL1yc0BuqL0?si=0olq0OiS8HuT6Pan).

2. These are both great videos to learn and understand graphql. The first video is by an IBM software engineer named \"Martin Keen\". I've met him IRL before, he's a nice guy and very knowledgeable.

3. Create your project 

mkdir test_graphql

4. Create and activate your virtual environment.

cd test_graphql
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the following libraries.

pip3 install fastapi
pip3 install sqlmodel
pip3 install strawberry-graphql
pip3 install requests
pip3 install uvicorn

6. In VSCode install the following extensions if you haven't already.

SQLite by alexcvzz https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite

SQLite Viewer by Florian Klampfer https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer

7. 





Run your application using the following code
cd test_graphql
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload



The app should start running on the following port.
http://127.0.0.1:8000

To see the docs open the following url in your browser.
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs


After you've looked at the docs, open this link in your browser. Note the /graphql at the end of it.
http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql

Delete all the text in the text area that starts with \"Welcome to GraphiQL\".




In the text area paste the following mutation. Then press the purple run button. 
It should return a \"data\" object that looks exactly like the mutation.
createAuthor is the function being called. 
The id, name, and email are the values that will be returned from the function.

mutation {
    createAuthor(name: "Alice", age: 29, nationality: "British") {
        id
        name
        age
        nationality
    }
}

In the text area paste this new mutation and click the run button. This will be used to create a book.

mutation {
    createBook(title: "Lord of the Rings", publicationYear: 1954, genre: "fantasy", authorId: 2) {
        id
        title
        publicationYear
        genre
        authorId
    }
}


You can use this query to get an author.

query {
    getAuthor(id: 1) {
        id
        name
        age
        nationality
        books
    }
}

query {
    getAllAuthors {
        id
        name
        age
        nationality
        books {
          id
          title
          publicationYear
          genre
          authorId
        }
    }
}

You can use this query to get a book. 

query {
    getBook(id: 1) {
        id
        title
        publicationYear
        genre
        authorId
    }
}

query {
    getAllBooks {
        id
        title
        publicationYear
        genre
        authorId
    }
}
